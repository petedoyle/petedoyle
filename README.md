### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I mostly work with Android, and a little Go. I've worked on Xbox Smartglass, Whistle, and I'm currently at Amazon trying to push Android further internally.

I love startups and hope to be a founder some day, hopefully while working remotely as a digital nomad. Feel free to say hi on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/petedoyle_)!
